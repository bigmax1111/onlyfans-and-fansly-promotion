## ✅ Step 1: Buy Aged Reddit Accounts and Set Up Anti-Detect

You’ll need accounts with:
- Post karma: **3,000+**
- Comment karma: **200+**
- Age: preferably **6+ months**

Good accounts cost ~$25–30. Use tools like **Dolphin Anty** and IPv4 proxies if working with multiple accounts.

Make sure to:
- Enable **NSFW content** in Reddit settings
- Enable **Adult content visibility**

---

## ✅ Step 2: Create a Professional Profile

In your bio, describe:
- Your content style (e.g., girl-next-door, cosplay, dominant, etc.)
- Your platforms (OnlyFans, Fansly)
- Discounts, trial links, promotions

Use **custom tracking links** for OnlyFans to monitor traffic.

## ✅ Step 3: Find Subreddits and Post Content

- Search Reddit for NSFW subreddits or use curated tools like Postpone
- Many subreddits require **verification** — do it once and access high-traffic groups
- Use **Imgur** for images and **RedGIFs** for videos

When posting:
- Use the “Link” format in Reddit
- Insert imgur link
- Add a catchy headline
- Mark as NSFW
- Post to 30–40 subreddits/day with different images/text

---

## ✅ Step 4: Use Auto-Posting Tools to Scale

Tools like **Postpone** allow you to:
- Schedule 50–100 posts in 30 minutes
- Manage multiple Reddit accounts
- Get subreddit activity insights
- Choose the best posting times

Cost starts at ~$39 for 5 accounts.

## ✅ Results and Analytics

Even without manual optimization, Reddit posts can drive hundreds of clicks per day. Posting in verified subreddits and using custom text/images increases visibility.

With poster tools, you save time and keep traffic consistent. Example:
- 60+ posts/day = significant OF traffic
- Best results from unique, niche, engaging posts

---

## ✅ Summary

Reddit is a goldmine for **OnlyFans and Fansly traffic** if used right:
- Start slow with one account
